# TensorFlow Lite Neural Networks for Mobile Devices - Speech Recognition

## Project Overview
This project focuses on integrating **TensorFlow Lite** neural networks into a mobile application for **speech recognition**. The goal is to develop a **notepad app** that allows users to input text using their voice. The app will leverage **Speech-To-Text** technology to convert spoken words into written text, making note-taking more convenient and accessible.

## Key Features
- **Voice Input for Text**: Users can dictate notes instead of typing.
- **Integration with TensorFlow Lite (LiteRT)**: Efficient deployment of AI models on mobile devices.
- **User-Friendly Notepad Interface**: Simple and intuitive UI for easy note management.

## Project Goals
- Develop a functional mobile application that integrates **Speech-To-Text** processing.
- Create a tutorial demonstrating how to implement **TensorFlow Lite** for speech recognition in mobile apps.
- Optimize performance for real-time speech recognition with low latency.

## Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Android (Kotlin)
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow Lite (LiteRT)
- **Speech Recognition**: Pre-trained Speech-To-Text model

## Usage
1. Open the application.
2. Press the microphone button to start voice recording.
3. Speak your notes.
4. The app converts speech into text and saves it.
5. Edit, delete, or organize notes as needed.
